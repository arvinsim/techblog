During this site redesign, I wanted to check if my text look
good against the background. I only learned later that the term is called
[contrast-ratio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_ratio).

So I googled around to find a tool that would help me with that task.
Fortunately, I found a minimalistic tool that is just right for my use case.

[Contrast-Ratio](https://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/)
is a tool to check if the contrast ratio of your text and background
match the [WCAG standards](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#visual-audio-contrast).
In layman's terms, it indicates if your font and background combination has enough contrast to be readable.  

As a rule of the thumb, WCAG recommends a contrast ratio of 4.5:1

I used this to get this light-on-dark theme that this site currently has. It has a contrast
ratio of 10, which is more than enough to pass the WCAG standards.
