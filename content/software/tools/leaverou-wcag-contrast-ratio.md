[Contrast-Ratio](https://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/)
is a tool to check if teh contrast ratio of your text and background
match the WCAG standards. In layman's terms, it shows you have
if your font and background combination has enough contrast 
to be readable.

I am primarily a web developer, not a designer. That means that I
struggle with implementing concepts that a web designer might take
for granted.

These kinds of tools lessen the friction of creating a web design
from scratch.
